    <br>
    <p><b>(Somewhere in LA, at evening, Ryan's House)</b></p>
    <p><b>Ciana</b>: Mom, Dad it's time for holiday.</p>
    <p><b>Whitby</b>: (Ciana's Mom). Yes that's true, should we travel to New York City.</p>
    <p><b>Ciana</b>: (Excited). Mom how did you know? I was about to say that.</p>
    <p><b>Whitby</b>: Ciana, that's what you always say.</p>
    <p><b>Ryan</b>: (Ciana's Dad). I think that will be lovely, lets get ready tomorrow.</p>
    <p><b>Ciana</b>: (Hugs him). Thanks Dad (Goes to her room). I am so so happy, by tomorrow I will start packing. I am so so happy this needs to be written in my diary.</p>
    <p>(Dreams of NYC playing, Verse 1)</p>
    <p>In a small town, under starry skies so pretty, Lived a girl with dreams, so wild and free. She'd close her eyes, imagining a city so bright, New York, oh New York, her heart's guiding light.</p>
    <p>(Chorus)</p>
    <p>Now she's packing her bags, with a smile so pretty, Her dreams are coming true, in the city that's so gritty. New York City, she's on her way, so ready, With a heart full of hope, and a spirit so steady.</p>
    <p>(Song stops slowly)</p>
